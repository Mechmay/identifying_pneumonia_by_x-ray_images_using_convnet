# identifying_pneumonia_by_x-ray_images_using_convnet
2.56 million people died from pneumonia in 2017. Almost a third of all victims were children younger than 5 years, it is the leading cause of death for children under 5.  Pneumonia is an infection of the tiny air sacs of the lungs, called alveoli. In a person with pneumonia the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and reduces the oxygen intake. Pneumonia is caused by a number of different infectious agents, including viruses, bacteria and fungi. In this project, I will train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify chest X-rays as either 'NORMAL' or 'PNEUMONIA' showcasing the power of deep learning in the medical domain.
